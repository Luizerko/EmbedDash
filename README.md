# EmbedDash

EmbedDash is an interactive tool to visualize and compare embeddings generated by different dimensionality reduction algorithms. By utilizing diverse datasets, setups, and interactive tools, we seek to provide researchers with a comprehensive visual comparison of TriMap, UMAP, t-SNE, and PaCMAP. This approach allows researchers to gain deeper insights into the data, understand the relationship between visualizations and the underlying semantic space, and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Equipped with this tool, researchers will be better positioned to choose the most suitable method for their specific needs.
